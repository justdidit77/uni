1.Whichofthefollowingconditionsaretrue,ifa=13 andb=14? 

a) a+1<=b 

b) a+1>=b 

c) a+1!=b 

 

 

 

2.Explainthemistake(s) inthefollowingcode: 

myage=input(Howoldareyou) 

Print(Hithere,youare+myage+old) 

 

2.we need to put quotation marks for strings to be read from the machine like: 

 myage = input('how old are you') 

print ('hi there, you are'+myage +'old') 

 

 

3.Explainwhythefollowingcode won’treallyaddthetwo“numbers”: 

number1=input("Enterfirstnumber") 

number2=input("Entersecondnumber") 

result=number1+number2 

print(“Theresultis”+result) 

 

3.because script is reading number1 and number 2 as strings, it needs to be converted to “int” 

 

 

4.Write code to calculate the average of: {3, 11, 78, 112, 4, 18} in one single line of code. 

4.print((3+11+78+112+4+18)/6) 

5. Write a program that asks the user for an integer number and then prints out the remainder after the number is divided by 7. 

 

5. num= int(input("enter a number")) 

num = (num/7) 

print (num) 

 

6. Expand the above program (5.) by also printing out how often the number 7 “fits” into the number the user entered. 

 

7.What is the error in thisstatement? 

If scoreA =scoreB : 

print("Tie") 

7. to say that 2 thing match in an if statement we need to type two ‘==’ 

 

8. Supplyaconditioninthisifstatementtotestiftheuserentered a“Y”: 

userInput = input("Enter Y to quit.") 

if . . . //supplystatement 

print("Goodbye") // if the user entered“Y” 

8. userInput = input("Enter Y to quit.") 

if userInput == "Y": 

    print('Goodbye')
